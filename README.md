# mutscan_manuscript_2022

This repository contains the code used in the mutscan manuscript (analysis of datasets using mutscan, Enrich2 and DimSum, comparison and visualization).

The configuration files for each data set can be found in the respective subfolders. In most cases, settings similar to those used in the DiMSum manuscript were used (see https://www.dropbox.com/s/rben1n4lo6dvr5z/misc.zip?dl=0&file_subpath=%2Fmisc%2Finputfiles).
